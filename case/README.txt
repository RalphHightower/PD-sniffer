This case has very fine features, mainly the latch, and works best when printed in plastics like PETG.
It was validated in transparent SUNLU PETG using a 0.4mm nozzle, sliced with variable layer height
(adaptive, factor 0.5) and 50% infill with PrusaSlicer 2.5.2. The LED shines brightly through the case
so no aperture for the LED was added.

SolveSpace exports triangle meshes that are a little broken, and the STL files included were repaired
through the Netfabb service.
